## Strategy Design Pattern

* Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
* Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that turns a set of behaviors into objects and makes them interchangeable inside an original context object.




### Usage examples: 
* The Strategy pattern is very common in Python code. Itâ€™s often used in various frameworks to provide users a way to change the behavior of a class without extending it.

### Identification: 
* Strategy pattern can be recognized by a method that lets a nested object do the actual work, as well as a setter that allows replacing that object with a different one.
