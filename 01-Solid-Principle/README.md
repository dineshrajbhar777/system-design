# Solid Principle of OOPs

* S - Single Responsibility Principle
* O - Open / Closed Principle
* L - Liskov Substitution Principle
* I - Interface Segmented Principle
* D - Dependency Inversion Principle

------------------------------------------

### S - Single Responsibility Principle
* A class should have only 1 reason to change

### O - Open / Closed Principle
* Open for Extension but Closed for Modification

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle
* If Class B is subtype of Class A, then we should be able to replace object A with B without breaking the behaviour of the program
* Subclass should extend the capability of parent class not narrow it down

### I - Interface Segmented Principle
* Interface should be such that client should not implement unnecessary function they do not needed

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle
* Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes

------------------------------------------

# Advantage of following these Principles:

Help us to write better code:
* Avoid duplicate code
* Easy to maintain
* Easy to understand
* Flexible Software
* Reduce Complexity
